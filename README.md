# Web Data Management Project CSE-5335

1. ##What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why? 
>>####I chose PostgreSQL which is a SQL database because i had done some work on NoSQL in my other database class. But i wanted to try my hand on SQL database for this project.  

2. ##What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
>>####Set up of the ruby on rails framework and programming my database queries on ruby was the part that i found a bit easy. 

3. ##What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
>>####Understanding the flow of ajax calls and the implementation of ajax calls is what was difficult for me in this project. 
>>####Passing values and data from views to controller and back and getting the right format of data was also a bit tricky.  


5. ##If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
>>####If i am to use these technologies then my biggest concern would be to finalize the flow of the data and the format in which the data is going to be queried, transfered or displayed. Syntax is never a problem. Its the flow that was difficult for me. So that will be my concern for my future projects.
